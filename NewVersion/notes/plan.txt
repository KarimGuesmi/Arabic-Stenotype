Preparation 
*************
*************
1. download lots of Arabic texts (seperate files)
txt files (is better)

2. split your text into sentences 
(look for the ".")
split sentences into words



Mr. Guesmi 
.

3. download an Arabic dictionary 
. * groups 
prefixe
prepositions 
numbers
prepare table of gramatical endings 


4. download words frequency table for arabic
(only with one stroke if possible)
(make the frequency table based on the downloaded books)

kutya
kutyát
kutyának
(if all three words appreas => the table should display kutya appears 3 times)
(the endings list should also be displayed t appears 1 time / nak appears 1 time)

5. check tables if there are mistakes (the / teh) 
run some 
use dictionary Arabic, if word is containing in the dictionary => good
if word is not in the dictionary => manually check

6. one caracter may have many sounds 
read wikipedia for more tricks
expl:
. ala 
al.a
???? 
??????


7. Have a romanisation translator
arabic by latin letters

8. split words into sounds ,
caracter into many sounds

????
??????

Genetic algorithm implementation:
*********************************
making dictionary
GA

1. decide what an entity looks like ?
decide what sort of rules are allowed
fi ? trsnlated to "STENOKEY" (STPH)
4 keys 

special combination for "al" - prefixe
special combination for postfixes

simplification rules
conditional rules : l + .. a stenokey or other combinaiton


2. generate some random entities
GA it requires some entities

3. ruleset ---->  steno dictionary --> analyse the text (for all entities "ruleset")
this is a table , which strokes you have to enter on the steno machine to create this sentence.
look in the dictionary, "this"=>stroke (couple of keys) ...


4. compare the fitness values of the analysed texts

how to compute the fitness value, 
a and b in the other file 


5. crossover : switch only random parts of 2 random entities.
mutation: select one entity and randomly change it.

6. you have created new entities , now go back to 3: (loop) , 4,5,6  for a long time

7. after taking 100 steps stop the loop 

8. generate the final dictionary using the entity with the highest fitness value
 
9. try the new dictionary.
