fitness computation
- analyse some sentences (turn them to strokes)
	- the shorter the outlines, the better the score
		- (word count of sentence * 3 + character count * 2 + count of frequent words * 3) - (outline count * 7)
- analyse the dictionary (the dictionary that the entities produce; a dictionary entry is (Arabic word) -> outline)
	- if words clash (have the same outline), PENALTY
		- if frequent words clash, BIG PENALTY
	- score for physical comfort of strokes
		- ideas: http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?typing_effort
		- if stroke is difficult, PENALTY
			- if frequent word's stroke is difficult, BIG PENALTY
		

		
outline = series of strokes
	hello = HLO
	hello = HEL/LO
